# 🚀 Random Forest Classifier for Financial Market Predictions 💹

Welcome to a thrilling journey where we fuse the exciting world of finance with the cutting-edge realm of machine learning! This repository holds the key to predicting financial markets, specifically the S&P 500, using Python and the ever-reliable Random Forest algorithm from Scikit-learn. 

Get ready to dive into a world of predictive analytics, backtesting, data visualization, and hyperparameter optimization! 🧪📊

## 🔍 What the code does

First, we gear up and get ready by importing all the necessary Python libraries and setting hyperparameters for our RandomForestClassifier. 📚 We then put together our RandomForestClassifier model with these carefully selected parameters. 

We then define two critical functions: `predict()` and `backtest()`.

The `predict()` function is our oracle 🧙‍♂️, that fits our model to the training dataset, casts predictions on the test dataset, and categorizes the predicted probabilities into class 1 or class 0 based on a threshold. The function finally gifts us a DataFrame combining the truth—the actual target values—and the predictions.

The `backtest()` function, our time-travelling tool, performs a rolling window backtesting on the data, computes precision and recall scores for the predictions, and merges all our predictions and actual target values for each iteration into a single DataFrame. It also kindly computes and shares the average precision and recall scores.

Once these functions are set up, we let them loose! The script carries out backtesting, assembles predictions, and calculates the precision score. The outcome? Delivered right to your console! 💻

Visual learners, rejoice! 🎉 The script generates a picturesque plot of the S&P 500 closing prices and overlays it with green and red markers—our "Buy" and "Sell" signals, respectively—based on the predictions. 

Moreover, the plot can be customized! 🎨 The user gets to choose the number of days to display on the plot. The script then filters the data and predictions for that period and regenerates the plot.

Lastly, the code has a secret weapon: hyperparameter optimization. It unleashes two formidable techniques—`RandomizedSearchCV()` and `GridSearchCV()`—to find the best parameters for our RandomForestClassifier model. And of course, it promptly shares the best parameters and their corresponding scores.
