# 🚀 Random Forest Classifier for Financial Market Predictions 💹

Welcome to an engaging exploration, merging the dynamic world of finance with the pioneering domain of machine learning! This repository holds the secret to predicting financial markets, specifically the S&P 500, employing Python and the reliable Random Forest algorithm from Scikit-learn.

Embark on an adventure filled with predictive analytics, backtesting, data visualization, and hyperparameter optimization! 🧪📊

## 🔍 Code Functionality

Initially, we set the stage by importing all necessary Python libraries and defining hyperparameters for our RandomForestClassifier 📚. Our RandomForestClassifier model is then constructed with these meticulously chosen parameters.

Two vital functions, predict() and backtest(), are defined.

Our soothsayer, the predict() function 🧙‍♂️, fits our model to the training dataset, formulates predictions on the test dataset, and classifies the predicted probabilities into class 1 or class 0 based on a threshold. This function ultimately delivers a DataFrame merging the actual target values (the truth) and the predictions.

Our time-traveling apparatus, the backtest() function, executes a rolling window backtesting on the data, computes precision and recall scores for the predictions, and combines all our predictions and actual target values for each iteration into a single DataFrame. Furthermore, it calculates and presents the average precision and recall scores.

Once these functions are established, they are set into motion! The script initiates backtesting, compiles predictions, and calculates the precision score, with results displayed directly on your console! 💻

For visual learners 🎉, the script creates an illustrative plot of the S&P 500 closing prices, overlaid with green and red markers—our "Buy" and "Sell" signals, respectively—based on the predictions.

Furthermore, plot customization is possible! 🎨 Users can select the number of days to display on the plot. The script subsequently filters the data and predictions for the specified period and re-renders the plot.

Lastly, the code boasts a unique feature: hyperparameter optimization. It employs two robust techniques—RandomizedSearchCV() and GridSearchCV()—to discover the optimal parameters for our RandomForestClassifier model. The best parameters and their corresponding scores are then promptly reported.
